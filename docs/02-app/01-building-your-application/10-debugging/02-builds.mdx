## Memory Usage

To debug memory usage during a build, you can add the `--experimental-debug-memory-usage` flag in your `next build` script. This flag, currently in experimental mode, enables:

- Periodically printing the current memory usage of the process.
- Records garbage collection events and warns about long running Garbage Collection events.
  - Kills the process if it detects Garbage Collection thrashing near heap limit.
- Automatically takes a heap snapshot if heap usage rises above 70% of the total heap or is close to running out of memory.
- Prints a report at the end of the build with information about peak memory usage and time spent in garbage collection.
