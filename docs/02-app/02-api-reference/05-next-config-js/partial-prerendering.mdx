Experimental support for Partial Prerendering (PPR). PPR is available in Next.js 14 and allows static portions of a page to be pre-generated and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in a single HTTP request.

You can enable PPR in your Next.js project by setting the experimental `ppr` flag:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
};
 
module.exports = nextConfig;
```
